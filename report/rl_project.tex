% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\section{Problem Definition}

A clear, precise and concise description of your chosen problem, including the states, actions, transition dynamics, and the reward function. You will lose marks for an unclear, incorrect, or incomplete problem definition.

\section{Background}

A discussion of reinforcement learning methods that may be effective at solving your chosen problem, their strengths and weaknesses for your chosen problem, and any existing results in the scientific literature (or publicly available online) on your chosen problem or similar problems.

\subsection{DQN (Mirco)}
The Game of Breakout was first mastered by the Deep Q Network agent (DQN) introduced by (reference to article).
DQN was the first  value based RL method to achieve and surpass human perfornaces at Breakout and it was tehrefore chosen as a one of the three algorithms we implemented.
(Reference to the article) show how  DQN was able to reach the score xxx.
This was possible by
(Reference to DDQN the article)

Details about its components and implementation are given in section 3.
DQN is an off policy value based method.
DQN was first introduced by Deep Mind (reference to article) to play and master the Atari games.
DQN was the first agent capable to match and surpass human performances at Breakout
+ Strengths:
DQN uses a target network
Stable learning 
Being an off policy methods based on Q learning, DQN uses bootstraping.

+ Weaknesses
The learning process is slow. The agent takes several milions of frames to reach human performances.
DQN tends to overestimate the state value fuctions. Argumment little more.
